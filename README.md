# fakeRESTApiParsing
Using https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ REST API with fake data and for practice JSON parsing with Swift 3.0


I have used some thirdparty pod files like 

[Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) for image fetching<br />
[NVActivityIndicatorView](https://github.com/ninjaprox/NVActivityIndicatorView) to show activity indicator<br />
[Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for web services call
